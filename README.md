react hooks practice


This is cricket match simulation project where we have used 'useState' react hook for the implementation.
In this project we have India's golden opening pair Rohit and Shikhar as openers and you can add the runs to their score. 
There is also facility to see team score and individual score of each batsman. You can track overs as well


Many more functionalities to come.


Stay tuned!
